Folium provides a convenient tab to install any Minecraft plugin from various sources. You can also upload the plugin's `.jar` file manually.

> Bukkit/Spigot plugins can only be installed on Bukkit-based server softwares. It is recommended to use `Paper` or `Purpur` unless you prefer to run a *modded* server. Modded servers **do not support plugins**.

## Method 1: using the Plugins tab

1. Log in to your Folium panel and select the server you would like to install the plugin on.
2. Go to the `Minecraft -> Plugins` tab.
3. Choose a plugin provider from the drop-down menu. The default is `Modrinth`.
4. Search for your plugin using the search bar.
5. Click on the download icon next to the plugin name, and choose the correct version.
	- Folium will automatically choose the latest version of the plugin that supports your server version. This is usually what you want, but sometimes you want an older version of the plugin (for example, to make Simple Voice Chat compatible with older clients instead).

## Method 2: uploading the plugin jar

1. Find the plugin's .jar file on sites such as [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) and download it.
2. Go to the `Files` tab on your Folium panel.
3. Open the `plugins` folder.
4. Drag and drop the `.jar` file into the panel, or click the upload icon then `Files`.

> With this manual method, you must make sure to install the correct version of the plugin, whereas the Plugins tab will make sure the plugin is compatible.
