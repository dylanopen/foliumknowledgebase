Folium's default JVM version of `Java 21` is good enough for almost all use-cases, but in some specific scenarios you may want to change it.

## Changing the docker image

1. Log in to your server's panel.
2. Make sure your server is offline (stopped).
3. Go to the `Environment -> Startup` tab.
4. Under the drop-down titled `Docker Image`, choose the Java version you would like to install.
5. Start your server. The new Java version should automatically install.
