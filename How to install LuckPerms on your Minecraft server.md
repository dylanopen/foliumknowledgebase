LuckPerms allows you to create groups for players and give them certain permissions.

Why is this useful compared to just using `/op`? Opped players have _every permission_, and you might not want to give all players full access to every command.

## What can you do with LuckPerms?

LuckPerms allows you give certain groups of people specific permissions. For example, you could have a `Moderator` role who could switch gamemodes, teleport to other players and ban people, but would not have full OP.

## Installation

To install LuckPerms:

1. Stop your server.
2. Go to the `Minecraft -> Plugins` tab for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper-based servers.
3. Go to the `Minecraft -> Mods` tab for modded servers.
4. Search for `LuckPerms`.
5. Install the latest compatible version of LuckPerms.
6. Start your server. You should now have access to the `/lp` command.

## Configuration

You can connect LuckPerms to a shared database if you want to share groups across servers on a network. This is not currently covered in this guide.

Other than database config, configuration is done entirely in-game with the `/lp` command or the web editor. Please see our other guides below on how to manage roles using LuckPerms:
