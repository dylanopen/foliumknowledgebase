Folium provides a convenient tab to install any Minecraft modpack from various sources.

> Modpacks can only be installed on modded server softwares (mainly Fabric and (neo)Forge. It is recommended to use `Fabric` unless the modpack you require only support Forge. Plugin-based server softwares, such as Paper, **do not support mods and modpacks**.

## Using the Modpacks tab

1. Log in to your Folium panel and select the server you would like to install the modpack on.
2. Go to the `Minecraft -> Modpacks` tab.
3. Choose a mod provider from the drop-down menu. The default is `Modrinth`.
4. Search for your mod using the search bar.
5. Click on the download icon next to the modpack name, and choose the correct version.
6. It is recommended to use the `Delete Files` option if your server does not contain anything important. This helps resolve file merge conflicts.
