The server software PaperMC patches a lot of exploits that work in the vanilla game: such as TNT and gravity duplication, bedrock-breaking exploits, etc.

Most of these exploits can be 'unpatched' by configuring PaperMC's global configuration.

## Configuring paper-global.yml from the Configs tab

1. Log in to the panel and make sure your server is stopped.
2. Go to the `Configuration -> Configs` tab.
3. Select `paper-global.yml` from the drop-down to the left of the search bar.
4. You can search for any config options using the search bar. Just search for a single word of the query or its full name in the config (e.g. `allow-piston-duplication`).
5. Make sure to click the `Save` button once you have finished configuring.

## Configuring the paper-global.yml file manually

1. Log in to the panel and make sure your server is stopped.
2. Go to the `Files` tab.
3. Open the `config` folder.
4. Select the `paper-global.yml` file.
5. Press `ctrl+F` to search for specific text in the file.
6. Make sure to click the `Save` button to save the file when you have finished configuring.

## Allow TNT duplication

To allow TNT duping, set the `allow-piston-duplication` option to `true`:

```
allow-piston-duplication: true
```

> This option is in the `unsupported-settings` category. This doesn't mean it's *unsafe*, just that you may not receive support from Paper if you change this.

## Allow bedrock breaking

To allow breaking unbreakable blocks such as bedrock, set the `allow-permanent-block-break-exploits` option to `true`:

```
allow-permanent-block-break-exploits: true
```

> This option is in the `unsupported-settings` category. This doesn't mean it's *unsafe*, just that you may not receive support from Paper if you change this.

## Allow gravity block duplication

To allow duplicating gravity blocks such as sand, gravel and concrete, set the ` allow-unsafe-end-portal-teleportation` option to `true`:

```
allow-unsafe-end-portal-teleportation: true
```

> This option is in the `unsupported-settings` category. This doesn't mean it's *unsafe*, just that you may not receive support from Paper if you change this.

## Allow headless pistons

Some exploits rely on 'headless pistons' to work properly. Paper by default patches these, but you can unpatch it.

To allow headless pistons, set the `allow-headless-pistons` option to `true`:

```
allow-headless-pistons: true
```

> This option is in the `unsupported-settings` category. This doesn't mean it's *unsafe*, just that you may not receive support from Paper if you change this.
