When a new Minecraft update releases, you will likely want to update to the latest version. This can be done with a single click in the panel.

This guide also covers how to switch to a different server software.

> It is important to note that updating **before** you have made sure all plugins/mods are compatible with the latest version, can be dangerous. Always make sure the plugins and mods work with the latest version before changing your live server.

## Method 1: using the Folium panel

1. Log in to your panel at https://panel.foliumhosting.net.
2. Make sure your server is currently **offline**.
3. Make a backup of your server before changing anything about the server software (see [How to make a backup of your server](https://billing/foliumhosting.net/knowledgebase/PLEASE/INSERT/LINK/HERE)).
4. Go to the `Minecraft -> Versions` tab.
5. Click on the server software you would like to install.
6. Click on the version you would like to install.
7. **Do not** enable the `Delete Files` slider unless you want to delete all your server files and start from scratch.
8. Enable the `Accept EULA` slider if you have read [Minecraft's EULA](https://minecraft.net/eula) and want to automatically accept it once the server is installed.
9. Click `Install` and wait for the installer to finish.
10. Start your server.

## Method 2: installing the server software manually

This way is not generally recommended, because the panel will generally fix any incompatibilities and is therefore 'safer' than manually updating. For the sake of completeness, though, here are the steps to manually install a new server software version:

1. Find the `.jar` file of the new server software version online, from the official website of the software.
2. Log in to your panel at https://panel.foliumhosting.net.
3. Make sure your server is currently **offline**.
4. Make a backup of your server before changing anything about the server software (see [How to make a backup of your server](https://billing/foliumhosting.net/knowledgebase/PLEASE/INSERT/LINK/HERE)).
5. Go to the `Minecraft -> Files` tab.
6. Delete the `server.jar` file.
7. Upload the `.jar` file for the server software you just downloaded.
8. Rename the `.jar` file to `server.jar` if it is not already.
9. Start your server.
