By disabling mob griefing, creepers will not damage blocks when exploding, endermen will not pick up blocks, and skeletons will not be able to destroy item frames, among other consequences.

> Please note that, by disabling mob griefing, some unintended consequences may occur, such as villager breeders no longer working. Make sure you understand the result of changing a gamerule before applying it to your server.
