Folium provides a convenient tab for managing the players on your Minecraft server. One such feature of this tab is the ability to wipe a player's data from your server - this will reset their inventory, location, statistics, along with everything they have done **except** for any buildings they built/broke or any interactions with the world itself.

## Wiping players using the Players tab

1. Make sure the player is offline. If possible, stop your server.
2. Go to the `Minecraft -> Players` tab.
3. Click on the `Offline` button to view offline players.
4. Find the player you would like to wipe. Click on this player.
5. Choose the button called `Wipe Player`.
6. Select `Confirm` if you have confirmed.
