If you are getting a ClassNotFoundException on a modded server, it usually means that you forgot to install a mod dependency.

How to fix this issue:

- Read through the error carefully - what class is it failing to resolve? Usually, that will tell you which mod you need to install.
- Read the list of dependencies for any recently-installed mods. Do they depend on something you haven't installed?

If you are unable to fix the issue, please ask in the community-support channel in our Discord server.
