The `keepInventory` gamerule determines whether players drop their items on death, or whether they are kept in their inventory after they die.

## Enabling keep inventory

Run this command in-game:

```
/gamerule keepInventory true
```

Do not include the leading `/` if running from console.

## Disabling keep inventory

Run this command in-game:

```
/gamerule keepInventory false
```

Do not include the leading `/` if running from console.

## Alternative: graves

Instead of enabling keep inventory, some server owners like to use a plugin or datapack which stores players' items in a grave when they die, so that their items do not burn in lava or fall into the void, for example.
