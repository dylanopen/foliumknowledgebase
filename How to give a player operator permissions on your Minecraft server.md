To give a player operator permissions on your server, you should use the `op` command.

> If you are running this command through console, you should just type `op` and not `/op`.

Use the command like this in-game:

```
/op playerNameHere
```

Or like this through console:

```
op playerNameHere
```

> Please note that it is recommended to manage permission nodes through a plugin such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), rather than granting permission to use **all commands** by making a player an operator.
