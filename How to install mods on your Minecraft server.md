Folium provides a convenient tab to install any Minecraft mod from various sources. You can also upload the mod's `.jar` file manually.

> Mods can only be installed on modded server softwares (mainly Fabric and (neo)Forge. It is recommended to use `Fabric` unless the mod(pack)s you require only support Forge. Plugin-based server softwares, such as Paper, **do not support mods**.

## Method 1: using the Mods tab

1. Log in to your Folium panel and select the server you would like to install the mod on.
2. Go to the `Minecraft -> Mods` tab.
3. Choose a mod provider from the drop-down menu. The default is `Modrinth`.
4. Search for your mod using the search bar.
5. Click on the download icon next to the mod name, and choose the correct version.
	- Folium will automatically choose the latest version of the mod that supports your server version. This is usually what you want, but sometimes you want an older version of the mod (for example, to make Simple Voice Chat compatible with older clients instead).

## Method 2: uploading the mod jar

1. Find the mod's .jar file on sites such as [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) and download it.
2. Go to the `Files` tab on your Folium panel.
3. Open the `mods` folder.
4. Drag and drop the `.jar` file into the panel, or click the upload icon then `Files`.

> With this manual method, you must make sure to install the correct version of the mod, whereas the Mods tab will make sure the mod is compatible.
